Steps to Build the Project: \
Create a DynamoDB table to store the items. \
Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table. \
Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). \
Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency. \
